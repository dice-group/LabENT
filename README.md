# LabENT
This project employs a web application (dubb LabENT) for labelling entities in knowledge graphs that enable users to annotate selected entities based on clustering, then propagate the major type to all other entities within the same cluster. The project is configured to work within the DAIKIRI project pipeline for ontology learning and structured machine learning from industrial data.
